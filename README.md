# No LinkedIn News

## Abstract
This browser extension hides the news sections on LinkedIn. It was inspired by [DF Tube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna).

## Tech Stack
This project uses vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. 

## Setup/Installation
You can clone the repo locally using `git clone`. 

[This article](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) offers detailed instructions on loading an unpacked chrome extension. You can navigate to the chrome extensions page via the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar. From there, you can click "load unpacked extension" and choose the folder via the popup. You should then see the newspaper icon appear in the toolbar. When you click on it, you can see "Hide LinkedIn News." If you navigate to `linkedin.com/feed` or a specific news route starting with `linkedin.com/news` while logged in, you should not see any news information.

## Next Steps
Long term, I would like to enable and disable the extension using the popup (where the text "Hide LinkedIn News" is visible).
